During the setup, you will be prompted to enter various settings. These settings are crucial as they customize the bot's operations according to your needs. The setup process will create two important files:

- `.env` file: Contains all your settings.
- `_CONFIDENTIAL_DO_NOT_SHARE.csv`: This file lists all the wallets used by the bot. Keep this file secure and do not share it.

#### Step 3: Fund the Main Wallet

Once setup is complete, you need to fund the main wallet address provided by the bot. **This is the only wallet you need to fund directly!** The bot will automatically distribute the necessary funds to other associated addresses.

#### Step 4: Run the Bot

After funding, execute `02_run_bot.exe` to start the bot. The bot will begin trading based on the configurations you set during the setup process.
